# Dynamic Programming

These are my solutions to weeks 5 and 6 of the [Coursera Algorithmic Toolbox course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox), which is part of the [Data Structures and Algorithms Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms).

* _Money change_ - compute the smallest number of coins to make a target value
* _Primitive calculator_ - compute fastest way to get from 1 to n with a small number of arithmetic operations.
* I wrote a generic `Distance` class to solve both _Edit Distance_ and _Longest Common Subsequence_ Problems after realising the core is similar.
* _Arithmetic Expression_ - introduce brackets into an arithmetic expression to maximise its value.
* _Knapsack_ - maximise the amount you can put in a knapsack with fixed capacity. I wrote variations with and without repetition of the items.

These are all problems that can be solved using Dynamic Programming i.e. using a memo object to store calculation results.
